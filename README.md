# super-duper-carnival

My first cleanroom design of a debounce function in VHDL. Physically verified on Xilinx Spartan6. See second method [here](https://github.com/essess/super-guacamole).

Testbench where I hashed out and verified my initial ideas can be found [here](https://www.edaplayground.com/x/2qeG) at EDAPlayground.
